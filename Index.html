    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security
        attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">Web security attacks can be very damaging, but there are ways to mitigate negative
        consequences. It's very important to use defense in depth. For each layer a hacker has to pass through, your
        security improves by orders of magnitude. You should also use the principle of least privilege. This entails
        giving a user account access only to that which they need. Be careful of trusting the users. They could have
        gotten their identity stolen or be a former disgruntled employee that wants to hurt the company. Using the
        principle of least privilege and denying access to people that are no longer with the company can increase the
        security of the site. By implementing HTML sanitization either manually or using a third party, you can remove
        tags that are considered unsafe and can make the website vulnerable to malicious code. Use deny and allow lists
        to make intrusions less prevalent. Deny lists is a list where specific actions or data are not allowed to gain
        access to the server. Allow lists are the opposite and lists actions or data that is permitted. The problem with
        deny lists is that they only specify what should not gain access, so if something new appears you have to
        manually put it on the deny list. This means you are vulnerable the entire time before you put it there. With
        the allow list anything that is not on it is automatically denied, so you don't have the same problem.
